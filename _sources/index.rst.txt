NineToothed Documentation
=========================

**NineToothed** is a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Triton, offering higher-level abstractions. Through its tensor-oriented metaprogramming (TOM) model, it empowers developers to write high-performance compute kernels intuitively, without the need to manage low-level details like pointer arithmetic or memory access.
